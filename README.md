# University Radio Nottingham History Project

The history project collects and publishes information on past shows, committees and outside broadcasts at [University Radio Nottingham](http://urn1350.net).

We use a static site generator ([Jekyll](jekyllrb.com)) among other tools to turn the data and website source hosted here into the website published at [history.urn1350.net](https://history.urn1350.net).

This project is run by [a group](https://history.urn1350.net/humans.txt) from Univeristy Radio Nottingham.

## Special Thanks

- [The Nottingham New Theatre History Project](https://github.com/newtheatre/history-project) upon which this is heavily inspired and based.
