A link list is a standard format for representing a list of external resources used in various places on the site.

## <i class="fas fa-tags"></i> Attribute Reference

{% include def-doc.html def=site.data.defs.link-list %}

## <i class="fas fa-archive"></i> Archiving Resources

Linking to many online resources as part of a long-term project is risky. Websites may close or re-arrange their URLs rendering our links broken. To protect against this editors should create snapshots of resources when they link to them. These snapshots save the state of those resources at a single point in time. Unless the archiving service closes we should have a permanent record of all resources with snapshots.

We currently use [archive.is](https://archive.is/) to create snapshots. Snapshots are created by entering the URL of the resource to be saved on the archive.is website. A page will be returned with a five-character reference code in the URL. For example archiving example.com returns page whose URL is `https://archive.fo/oYs92`, the reference code is `oYs92`. This code should be placed in the `snapshot` attribute of the link list item.
