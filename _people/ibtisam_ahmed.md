We did a few specials on The Identity Talk but the one that stood out the most was an episode on the Pulse nightclub shooting the same week it happened. We cried through most of it and just held on to each other hugged afterwards. Radio lent our grief an empowered voice.

On The Disney Show, we got a listener message in about one of the geese campus he had decided to name Gilbert. It turned into an entire conversation about sidekicks and how uni students could just bag a goose for it. It was bonkers!

As of August 2018, still working on my thesis which is due for submission in November. Applying for post-doctoral positions at the moment.
