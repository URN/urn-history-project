Being on the committee and juggling final year of university was crazy but a lot of fun. Highlights include floating URN-ers on air-mattresses on the lake at University Park during move-in day, writing and directing BNOC Big Brother mini-Youtube Series to promote Student Union Elections, and doing my first ever all-nighter once I'd actually finished my course to finish off the Student Radio Award station entries.

Also singing 'Radio is Coming Home' as we reclaimed Best Station at the SRAs wasn't too bad.

I loved being part of such a creative and ambitious team. Whenever people had a vague idea they put everything into making it a reality even if it was completely hopeless and unsuccessful. That level of passion and dedication was really inspiring and gave me the drive to do whatever I wanted to do both at university and after I graduated.

After university I did a Masters in Broadcast Journalism at Nottingham Trent University and I'm currently now a Broadcast Journalist at the BBC.
