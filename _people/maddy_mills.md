Hannah and I created the most irritating sound effect in the history of URN, the Reveal the Wheel wheel spin. We created a special and sewed 6 episodes together, meaning the sound effect was played roughly every 5 minutes for 2 hours. 

Hannah, Heidi and I wrote and performed the GLURN special 'Varsity', a Varsity themed cover of Steps- Tragedy, the whole thing was indeed.. tragic.

Luckily, Beth & I were chosen to host the SU Elections 2018 live in front of an audience, quite the change from an enclosed studio it presented a variety of challenges but was an incredible experience none the less. 

The Hannah & Maddy Show won 'Best Headlines 2017' in the URN Awards for a segment called 'Off My Headlines', this covered the weirdest and most wonderful news of the week presented as if breaking serious news.

The 10 Hour Just Dance Marathon went live in the Portland Building Hub and was just that, 10 hours of non-stop flailing to cheesy music in the name of Sport Relief 2018.
