The digital era hadn't really got off the ground when I was at URN, so we still used to edit stuff together by literally cutting Revox tape up and sticking together it with tape, that was fun too.

Also, it was a huge amount of fun playing records off vinyl, using the faders to start records, giving them a lead-in of a few seconds to spin up to speed, timing them into the news at the top of the hour, loved doing it, it was very hands-on, CDs were only gradually coming into use.

Since then I've moved to Serbia and am now a professional translator/interpreter. I have not done much radio work since, but I do a lot of public speaking (including conference interpreting) and have also done quite a lot of voiceover work ([like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5r1JNnFjgag)), which URN definitely helped prepare me for!
