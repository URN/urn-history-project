So many stories, including when we gaffer taped the streaming server back together, photographing an interview with Feeder while the head of music forgot about their latest album, breaking the world record for longest DJ relay, working with Chris Moyles when he did his show from our studios and I remember when the awards shelf collapsed under the weight of all the awards if that counts.

Since I left URN I've been working in IT and I'm currently a cybersecurity analyst.
