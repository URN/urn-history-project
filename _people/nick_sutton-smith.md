Walking 50 miles back from Stoke On Trent in 24 hours for charity with Nick Clay was awful but really rewarding (this was for the inaugural Road To Nottingham, where 4 teams raced back to our studios on foot)

The SRA deadline for 2018 fell on a Friday and we had to completely pack up our beloved studios in A11 in the Portland Basement to move to the new media hub. That was the most tiring weekend, with myself, Johnathan Graydon, James Perkins, Bessie Ephgrave, Jamie Keene, Anna Lambert and a handful of other worked till 8am on the Monday. The place was completely destroyed, all the roof tiles had come out to get the wires out the ceilings and there was a load of stuff left over that we found throughout the weekend. It was a very humbling and emotional weekend saying goodbye to the studios.
