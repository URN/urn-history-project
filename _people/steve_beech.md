My favourite memories were the Outside Broadcasts we did, particularly covering the Student Union election results from The Portland Building into the early hours of the morning. The lessons I learned - talking to time, filling time and remembering the names of the candidates are skills I've used extensively when covering elections for the BBC since.

I remember producing a live programme from the Buttery Bar which was a rip-off of ITV's Blind Date. Some of the answers were some of the rudest things I've ever heard broadcast but also the funniest. The bar was the busiest it had been all year and as a result the bar manager offered me free drinks for the rest of the evening. Needless to say I can't remember going home but I'm assured I was carried!

I remember the very first time that URN gained a temporary FM licence in 2002. We broadcast from a mast on the campus which seemed to cover most of the city. The response was phenomenal and it was an exhilarating experience for all involved. We even received requests from prisoners at HMP Nottingham!

I started a job as a trainee news reporter on a commercial station just a few weeks after graduation in 1994. I later moved onto the BBC and more than twenty years on I still work in radio after spells in TV, training and technology. But I still tell people I learnt more about radio at URN than I ever did elsewhere!
