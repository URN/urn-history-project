Obviously being part of the team that won Station of the Year every year for the four years I was at URN - particularly 2011/12 and 2012/13 where I edited the entries. This was special.

Seriously too many to mention - most important thing was amazing friends! Oh and the time we invited Chris Moyles to come play!

Went onto be the Chair, Marketing Office and Executive Director of the Student Radio Association for four years, as well as an Officer of The Radio Academy.

I worked at Capital East Midlands and Smooth Radio as a Producer before taking a full time role within Global's Communications team as a Corporate Communications Manager, eventually returning to Capital to be a Network Producer across the whole 95-106 network from London, working with the likes of Ant Payne, Bass, Roman Kemp and Marvin Humes, and on events such as the Summertime Ball and Jingle Bell Ball.
