"I (Thomas Preece) developed a new format for The Big Picture in the 2008-09 year; when I was first given the show, it was a 45-minute show of mostly reports with one or two short debates that was pre-recorded in bits and edited together to go out early on a Sunday morning. I came up with a new format of 3 topics, each with a report and a debate, that went out as an hour-long live show initially on a Sunday evening and later moved to after The Pulse on a Wednesday."
