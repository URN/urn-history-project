On Call was a show presented by Jack Ellis in his first year at the station.

The idea was that if an After Dark show suddenly found they couldn't do their slot one evening and didn't have a suitable pre-rec, Jack would step in and play whatever music he could for two hours.

The show was made redundant after URN's 24/7 initiative, which saw "Legacy Pre-Recs" become a thing, so there would always be a show ready to go out.
