The Identity Talk started as an LGBTQ+ show and evolved into a wider chat discussing different ways of identifying, with the focus on various student experiences. Covering things like disabilities, race, religion, gender and sexuality, nationality, and language, just to name a few, the show tackled a new topic each week.
